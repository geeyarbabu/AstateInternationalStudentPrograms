            \n<b>Arkansas state mission</b>\n
            \nArkansas State University educate leaders, enhances intellectual growth, and enriches lives.

            \n\n<b>ASU System</b>
            \n\nThe ASU system includes campuses in Jonesboro (Craighead County), which offers degree programs through the doctoral level; Beebe (White County), Mountain Home (Baxter County), and Newport (Jackson County), where associate degree programs are offered; and at Heber Springs, Marked Tree, and Searcy. Arkansas State University-Beebe became part of the ASU System in 1955. It associated with White River Vo-Tech at Newport in 1992; that campus attained stand-alone status and is now Arkansas State University-Newport. The Mountain Home campus officially became ASU-Mountain Home on July 1, 1995. Delta Technical Institute at Marked Tree merged with ASU and became Arkansas State University Technical Center on July 1, 2001. A new campus was built for ASU-Heber Springs, which operates as a sister campus of ASU-Beebe. Foothills Technical Institute at Searcy was merged with ASU-Beebe on July 1, 2003, and is now ASU-Searcy, a technical institute of ASU-Beebe.
            \n\nASU offers bachelor\'s degree programs, master\'s degree programs and upper level courses through ASU degree centers at ASU-Beebe, ASU-Mountain Home, and three other cities -- Blytheville, Forrest City, and West Memphis—where partnership agreements have been established in cooperation with the local community colleges. ASU also operates an instructional site at nearby Paragould in Greene County.
            \n\nA-State has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. Current enrollment for the Jonesboro campus stands close to 14,000, and the system has an enrollment of greater than 21,000.

            \n\n<b>Degree Programs</b>
            \n\nMaster\'s degree graduate programs were initiated in 1955, and ASU began offering its first doctoral degree, in educational leadership, in the fall of 1992. A second doctoral program, in environmental science, was begun in the fall of 1997, and the doctoral program in heritage studies began in the fall of 2001. Newer doctoral programs are in environmental science, molecular biosciences and physical therapy. In the fall of 2016, Arkansas State will enroll the first class of approximately 115 students to its branch of the New York Institute of Technology\'s medical school. The medical school will be located on campus in the historic Wilson Hall.
            \n\nToday, the institution has more than 80,000 alumni. Programs at the specialist\'s, master\'s, bachelor\'s and associate degree levels are available through the various colleges: Agriculture, Engineering and Technology, Business, Education and Behavioral Science, Liberal Arts and Communication, Nursing and Health Professions, Sciences and Mathematics, and Undergraduate Studies.
